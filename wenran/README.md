# An End-to-End Automatic Methodology to Accelerate the Accuracy Evaluation of DNN under Hardware Transient Faults
This project is designed to quickly estimate the impact of bitflips on deep neural networks (DNNs) without fault injection. <br>
To validate the effectiveness of our approach, A-Mean, we compare the estimated results from A-Mean with ground truth data obtained through fault injection. <br>
The datasets used in this evaluation include ImageNet (2012 validation set), CIFAR100, CIFAR10, and STL10. (The ImageNet and STL10 need to be downloaded in advance) <br>

# T-Smade: A Two-stage Smart Detector for Evasive Spectre Attacks Under Various Workloads
This project is designed to detect two evasive Spectre attacks (evasive Spectre nop and evasive Spectre memory) using the two-stage models trained with Spectre attack. <br>
The two-stage models include the first stage workloads classifier and the second stage attack detector. <br>
The workloads include three types: realistic applications (6 appliccations), CPU stress test and memory stress test. <br>
