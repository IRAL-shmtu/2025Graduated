# Thesis Projects by iRAL Graduates (Class of 2025)

Welcome to the official repository of thesis projects by the Class of 2025 graduates from iRAL,
College of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University.

This database serves as a centralized archive of the academic and engineering work completed by individual graduate students. It includes:

- 🎓 **Final-year research papers**
- 💻 **Project source code and demos**
- 📂 **Open-source and private project directories**

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each graduate has a dedicated subdirectory under the `2025Graduated/` folder containing a single `README.md` file:
```
/2025Graduated/
    ├── Alice_Wang/
    │   └── README.md    # Project summary and external links
    ├── Bob_Li/
    └── …
```

- The `/open_source` directory contains code licensed for public use.
- The `/private` directory contains restricted materials that are **not open-source**, due to confidentiality or publication policies.

> All project code and data are hosted externally by the respective authors. No source code is stored in this repository.

## 📜 Licensing

- Open-source components are individually licensed under the terms specified in each project.
- For private parts, no license is granted. Redistribution or reuse without permission is strictly prohibited.
