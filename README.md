# Thesis Projects by iRAL Graduates (Class of 2025)

Welcome to the official repository of thesis projects by the Class of 2025 graduates from iRAL,
College of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University.

This database serves as a centralized archive of the academic and engineering work completed by individual graduate students. It includes:

- 🎓 **Research papers**
- 💻 **Project source code and demos**
- 📂 **Open-source and private project directories**

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each graduate has a dedicated subdirectory under the `2025Graduated/` folder containing a single `README.md` file:
```
/2025Graduated/
    ├── Alice_Wang/
    │   └── README.md    # Project summary and external links
    ├── Bob_Li/
    └── …
```

- Each `README.md` includes:
  - A brief description of the thesis topic
  - Key contributions or highlights
  - Links to the final paper and the graduate's personal code repository (e.g., GitHub)

> All project code and data are hosted externally by the respective authors. No source code is stored in this repository.
