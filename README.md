# Graduation Projects by iRAL Students (Class of 2025)

Welcome to the official repository of personal graduation projects from the **Class of 2025** members of the **Intelligent Robotics and Automation Lab (iRAL)**,  
**College of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University**.

This database serves as a centralized archive of the academic and engineering work completed by individual graduate students. It includes:

- 🎓 **Final-year research papers**
- 💻 **Project source code and demos**
- 📂 **Open-source and private project directories**

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each graduate has a dedicated subdirectory containing their project materials:

```
/students/
    ├── Alice_Wang/
    │   ├── paper.pdf
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── open_source/       # code that is publicly available
    │   └── private/           # confidential or unpublished components (if any)
    ├── Bob_Li/
    └── ...
```

- The `/open_source` directory contains code licensed for public use.
- The `/private` directory contains restricted materials that are **not open-source**, due to confidentiality or publication policies.

> If you're a team member, please contact your supervisor before sharing private components externally.

## 📜 Licensing

- Open-source components are individually licensed under the terms specified in each project.
- For private parts, no license is granted. Redistribution or reuse without permission is strictly prohibited.
